 #Step 1 = Check Total Transactions
 SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_transactions FROM creditcard; # Result : 284807
 
 
 #STEP 2 = Fraud vs Non-Fraud counts
 SELECT Class, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM creditcard
GROUP BY Class; # Result : Class 0 = 284315 And Class 1 = 492


#Step 3: Transaction Amount Summary
SELECT 
    MIN(Amount) AS min_amount, # Result : 0
    MAX(Amount) AS max_amount, # Result : 25691.16
    AVG(Amount) AS avg_amount  # Result : 88.34961925087359
FROM creditcard;


#Step 4: Fraud-Specific Analysis
SELECT COUNT(*) AS fraud_count
FROM creditcard
WHERE Class = 1; # Result : 492
#This tells us how many transactions are fraud

SELECT SUM(Amount) AS total_fraud_amount
FROM creditcard
WHERE Class = 1; # Result : 60127.96999999997
#Shows the total money lost due to fraud

SELECT Class, AVG(Amount) AS avg_amount
FROM creditcard
GROUP BY Class; # Result : Class 0 = 88.29 and Class 1 = 122.21
#Compares average transaction amounts for fraud vs non-fraud.Helps see if fraud tends to happen in bigger transactions.
#Insights from Step 4 = 492 transactions out of 284,807 â†’ confirms fraud is very rare (~0.17%).
#$60,128 total lost due to fraud.Shows that even a small number of fraudulent transactions can involve significant money.
#avg amt Class 0 = 88.29 and class 1 = 122.21.


#Step 5: Patterns & Insights
# Are high-value transactions more likely to be fraud?
SELECT Class, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM creditcard
WHERE Amount > 2000
GROUP BY Class;
# Answer :Class 0=675 and Class 1 = 1(For the given condition). Most large transactions are legitimate, but fraud occurs in high-value transactions too

# Does fraud happen more at certain times of day?
SELECT FLOOR(Time/3600) AS hour, COUNT(*) AS fraud_count
FROM creditcard
WHERE Class = 1
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
# Answer : It's Clear that Fraud is more common during certain hours


# Step 6 = Advanced Queries 
SELECT 
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN Class = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT(*), 4) AS fraud_percentage
FROM creditcard; # Fraud Percentage = 0.1727

SELECT * 
# Top N Largest Fraud Transactions
FROM creditcard
WHERE Class = 1
ORDER BY Amount DESC
LIMIT 10; # Finds the highest-value frauds.

# Fraud percentage by transaction amount range

SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN Amount < 50 THEN '0-50'
        WHEN Amount BETWEEN 50 AND 500 THEN '50-500'
        WHEN Amount BETWEEN 500 AND 2000 THEN '500-2000'
        ELSE '2000+' 
    END AS amount_range,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN Class = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT(*), 4) AS fraud_percentage
FROM creditcard
GROUP BY amount_range
ORDER BY amount_range;
#Shows whether fraud is more common in small, medium, or large transactions.
